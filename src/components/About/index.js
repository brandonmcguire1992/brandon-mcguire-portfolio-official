                        <p className='text-faded mb-5'>My name is Brandon McGuire. I was born in Monahans, Tx 
                        but raised in a small town called Wickett, Tx and 
                        have live here my whole life. I have worked as a
                        shipping/receiving supervisor, in the oilfield, as a cashier
                        and a waiter. I began working at the age of 15 and continued
                        to work. Upon graduating at Monahans High School, I began 
                        college for my degree in marketing, in which I didn't complete
                        due to financial issues. I have returned to school to 
                        receive my certificate in coding. I have always been one 
                        that will work until the job is completed correctly. I have
                        always seen myself to be like my dad and now that he's is gone,
                        it gives me more motivation to work and be successful
                        so that I will always know that he is proud of me.
